## Database Setup

The application uses MySQL as its database system. To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**: Install MySQL on your system if you haven't already.

2. **Database Configuration**: Open `application.properties` in the `resources` directory and configure your MySQL database connection properties, such as `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password`.

3. **Schema Creation**: The application automatically creates the necessary schema and tables on startup, thanks to Spring Data JPA. You can also manually create the schema using SQL scripts in the `resources` directory if needed.

4. **Database Initialization**: You can initialize the database with sample data or specific setup scripts, if required.

## Project Setup

To set up the project and run it locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Import into IDE**: Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. **Build and Run**: Build the project and run it as a Spring Boot application.

4. **Access the API**: The API will be accessible at the defined port (usually 8080) by default. You can explore and test the endpoints using Swagger or Postman, as mentioned in the API Documentation section.

## Project Structure

The application is organized as follows:

- `com.books.bookmarketplace.controller`: Contains controller classes for handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints.
- `com.books.bookmarketplace.entity`: Defines JPA entity classes for users, books, and transactions.
- `com.books.bookmarketplace.model`: Defines model classes for simplified data representation.
- `com.books.bookmarketplace.repository`: Provides repository interfaces for database operations.
- `com.books.bookmarketplace.service`: Contains service classes for handling the logic behind the API calls.
- `com.books.bookmarketplace.errorhandler`: Contains custom exception classes and global exception handling.
- `resources`: Configuration files, including application properties and database setup.

## Custom Exceptions

The application includes custom exception classes with specific purposes:

- `UserNotFoundException`: Thrown when a user is not found.
- `UserAlreadyExistsException`: Thrown when a user already exists.
- `BookNotFoundException`: Thrown when a book is not found.
- `BookAlreadyExistsException`: Thrown when a book already exists.
- `InventoryFullException`: Thrown when the inventory is full.
- `ValidationException`: Thrown for validation errors.

## Exception Handling

The `GlobalExceptionHandler` class handles all custom exceptions and other exceptions to provides meaningful error responses. It maps different exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes and custom error messages.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger and Postman, which provides interactive documentation for all endpoints in swagger.yml file and BookApplication.postman_collection.json.
