/**
 * Book.java:
 * 
 * Defines the "Book" entity class for a book marketplace application.
 * It represents books available in the marketplace, storing information such as book ID, ISBN, title, author,
 * edition, publication year, language, publisher, prices, description, category, condition, and status.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Annotated with @Entity to indicate it's a persistent entity to be mapped to a database table.
 * - Utilizes Lombok annotations to generate common methods like getters, setters, constructors, and builders.
 * - Defines validation constraints using Jakarta Bean Validation annotations for various book attributes.
 * - Establishes one-to-many relationships with the "Transaction" entity to track book transactions.
 * - Enumerates possible book categories, conditions, and statuses for standardized classification.
 * - Provides a method, depreciatePrice, for reducing the book's current price by 10%.
 *
 * The class serves as a blueprint for storing and managing book data in the application's database,
 * facilitating the exchange and tracking of books in the marketplace.
