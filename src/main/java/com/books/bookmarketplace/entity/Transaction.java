/**
 * Transaction.java:
 * 
 * Defines the "Transaction" entity class for a book marketplace application.
 * It represents a transaction made within the marketplace and includes details such as the transaction ID,
 * associated user and book, transaction date, amount, status, notes, and type (BUY or SELL).
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Annotated with @Entity to indicate it's a persistent entity in a database.
 * - Utilizes Lombok annotations for generating common methods like getters, setters, and constructors.
 * - Defines two enums for transaction types and statuses (TransactionType and TransactionStatus).
 * - Specifies validation constraints using Jakarta Bean Validation annotations.
 *
 * The class serves as a blueprint for storing and managing transaction data in the application's database.
