/**
 * TransactionRepository.java:
 * 
 * This Java file defines the "TransactionRepository" interface, which serves as a repository for accessing
 * transactions-related data in the database. It extends the JpaRepository interface to provide basic CRUD
 * operations for the "Transaction" entity. Additionally, it includes custom query methods for retrieving books
 * that a user has either sold or purchased.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Annotated with @Repository to mark it as a Spring repository component.
 * - Extends JpaRepository to inherit basic database operations for the Transaction entity.
 * - Provides custom queries to find books sold and purchased by a specific user based on transaction type.
 *
 * The repository plays a vital role in interacting with the database to access and manage transaction-related
 * information within the book marketplace application.
